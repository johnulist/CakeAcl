CakeAcl
=======

An Ajax based Acl Manager for CakePHP 2.x styled with the Twitter Bootstrap.

This plugin is based on the [AclManager](https://github.com/FMCorz/AclManager) plugin by FMCorz.
Although his plugin is very nice, it doesn't suit my needs and get exesive loading times when having a lot of controllers and actions.
So this is a start to fix that.
Also, the styling wasn't matching my projects, so I though I would use the Twitter Bootstrap classes to style it.
